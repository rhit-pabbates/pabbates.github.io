        <p>My name is Ethan Pabbathi and I am currently a Sophomore attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am currently majoring in Computer
            Science am involved in Greek Life on-campus. I am a brother at the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity and am also involved in a lot of 
            event planning and volunteer work. Throughout my career at Rose-Hulman, I have learned a lot about my major and have created several projects
            just like this website. From learning about game development to making aesthetically pleasing websites, I've built my personal portfolio
            with projects in a variety of programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>Apart from programming, I am involved in greek-life. Being in a fraternity has helped me develop skills that I won't learn in a 
            lecture or lab. I am constantly keeping myself and my brothers accountable and helping out whenever I can. I am also involved in 
            service events, volunteer work, and other philantropy related events. In my free time, I like to work out and excercise. Additionally,
            I like to play and watch basketball.
